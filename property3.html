                <h2>About My Education</h2>
                <p>Education is very important to me, it is the way that you can commit your dream. Other people don't want to study because of their lazyness, and others their parents don't have enough money to pay the tuition. Children studying private or public school they have luck because they want to commit their own dream's in the future, and me I want to focus on my study and goal and i want my dream come true!</p>
